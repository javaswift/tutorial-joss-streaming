It is built using Spring MVC, and features 3 use cases:

1. Streaming content from storage to the browser
2. Streaming content from the browser to storage
3. Generating content, e.g. by creaeting thumbnails from previously uploaded files


To see this project in action:

2. Put your account information in src/main/resources/credentials.properties
3. Run this command (it starts a container in the foreground):
    mvn jetty:run
4. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)
